USAGE

This program is capable of loading a .CBZ file type and flipping through pages as if it were a physical copy. Each page is displayed in a backwards order as well to simulate more of the genuine experience of reading a Japanese Manga. Some current functionality includes the ability to scan a Japanese character/sentence you don't know and it will display it back, allowing it to be copied and easily searched. Another exciting feature is direct translations within the app without having to switch over to a different app!
